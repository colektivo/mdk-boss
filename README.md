The Boss will be responsible to make you efficient moving around the museum tracking your time and pointing you how much money are you wasting.

The Boss Node app will be capturing the cards ids from the reader from different locations and store into a database.

To access to the readers is required to have root access so is necessary to run as sudo.

```bash

npm install

sudo node boss.js

```

Open the browser on http://localhost:3000
